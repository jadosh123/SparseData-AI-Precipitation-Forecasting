# Documentation of Journey

## The Goal

This document tracks the engineering challenges, architectural decisions, and solutions implemented throughout the development of the SparseData AI Precipitation Forecasting System.

## Domain Knowledge

I am currently studying Meteorology Today: An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment to bridge the gap between data science and physical atmospheric dynamics. I am mapping metrics provided by the Israeli Meteorological Service (IMS) (e.g., Temperature, Rain, Wind Direction) to theoretical concepts needed for feature engineering (e.g., Wind Convergence, Orographic Lift).

I am also studying A Tour of C++ by Bjarne Stroustrup to implement my regression kriging engine, transitioning from a O(N x M x F) where N is number of grid cells, M is the number of stations and F is length of the feature vector per station in slow python loops to optimized C++ code, I will then expose the engine to my python environment via pybind11 utilizing the fact that passing numpy arrays to C++ is a no copy operation O(1).

## System Architecture

To ensure scalability and industry-standard data flow, I adopted the Medallion Architecture:

- Bronze Layer (Raw): Ingested raw 10-minute intervals from IMS stations (Haifa, Tel Aviv, Tavor, etc.) directly into PostgreSQL.

- Silver Layer (Cleansed): Aggregating data to hourly intervals, handling missing values, and performing vector decomposition for wind speed/direction.

- Gold Layer (Features): (Planned) Final features ready for the Machine Learning models.

## Engineering & Infrastructure

1. **Environment & Dependency Management**
    - Transitioned to a strictly managed Python 3.11 Virtual Environment (.venv) to ensure reproducibility.

    - configured VS Code workspace settings to enforce the correct interpreter paths, eliminating "it works on my machine" errors.

    - Utilized Docker to containerize the PostgreSQL database, ensuring the data infrastructure is platform-agnostic (runs identically on WSL and Ubuntu Laptop).

2. **Project Structure ("Src Layout")**
    - Refactored the codebase into a standard Src Layout (separating source code src/ from tests tests/).

    - Implemented pyproject.toml for modern dependency management and to install the project in "Editable Mode" (pip install -e .), allowing seamless imports across scripts and tests.

3. **Quality Assurance & Testing**
    - Integrated pytest as the testing framework.

    - Data Integrity Guardrails: Developed automated tests to validate "Bronze" data physics before processing:
        - Absolute Bounds Checks: Detecting impossible values (e.g., Negative Rain, Temperature >50∘C).

        - Logic Consistency Checks: Ensuring T_max ​≥ T_avg​ ≥ T_min​.

        - Completeness Checks: Identifying critical missing data (NaNs) early in the pipeline.

4. **Workflow Synchronization**
    - Created a custom bash-based synchronization workflow using Google Drive to sync binary database dumps between my Desktop (WSL) and Laptop (Ubuntu), allowing frictionless switching between development machines.
