# Documentation of Journey

### The Idea
This will serve as a documentation of my journey where I will write my current ideas, challenges and solutions that I encounter for the entirety of this project.

### Journey
I am currently reading the book Meteorology Today An Introduction to Weather, Climate, and the Environment and I will list all the metrics provided by the Israeli Meteorological Service (IMS) to make it easier to see which ones are used to engineer important features discussed in the book or in meteorological papers.
